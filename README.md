# Kaggle-Data-Cleaning

Repository Description:

This repository contains my solved assignments from the Kaggle Data Cleaning course. The course focuses on practical techniques and strategies for cleaning and preprocessing datasets to ensure high data quality and enable accurate analysis. Each assignment in this repository demonstrates my understanding and proficiency in various data cleaning concepts and techniques.

Through the assignments, I have learned how to handle missing values, deal with outliers, address inconsistencies, perform data type conversions, and apply appropriate data transformation methods. The solutions provided showcase my ability to apply these techniques using popular Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

By sharing my completed assignments in this repository, I aim to demonstrate my practical skills in data cleaning and highlight my attention to detail in ensuring data integrity. These assignments serve as evidence of my ability to work with real-world datasets, clean them effectively, and prepare them for further analysis or modeling tasks.

Feel free to explore the repository and review the code solutions to gain insights into my approach and problem-solving capabilities in the field of data cleaning.
